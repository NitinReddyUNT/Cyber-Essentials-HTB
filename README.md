Hack The Box:
Hack The Box (HTB) is an online resource that offers a wide range of virtual
machines and tasks intended for ethical hacking training and penetration testing. Known as
"pentesters" or "ethical hackers," it offers a practical, interactive environment where
individuals may advance their skills in a controlled and secure environment.

Scanner Challenge : 
In the Hack the box platform we have selected Scanner- Medium Challenge in Hack the
box platform. The primary objective is to investigate the weaknesses that highlight the
algorithms shortcomings and find ways to fix them.

Project components : 
The Scanner is made up of different parts:
1. Binary/Executable: This is the program that is being tested for vulnerabilities. It is usually a file that can be executed on your system.
2. Source Code: If available, the source code gives an understanding of how the binary was created and what vulnerabilities it might have.
3. Debugger: Programs like GDB allow you to examine the running process, establish breakpoints, and control the execution flow.
4. Disassembler/Decompiler: Tools like objdump help analyze the binary code by breaking it down into assembly code or even attempting to convertit back to a higher-level language.
5.Payload Generator: In order to exploit a binary, it may be necessary to create payloads. Utilities such as pwntools for Python are useful in creating these payloads.
6.Shellcode: When looking at exploitation, shellcode consists of a series of commands that are inserted into the running application to carry out a taskbeyond the application's original purpose, usually to trigger a shell.
7.Exploit Script: This is a script (typically written in Python using pwntools) that streamlines the exploitation process.
It constructs and transmits the payload, and frequently communicates with the spawned shell.

Important Tools used : 
1)GDB tool : By using GDB, we can uncover valuable information about the challenge's algorithm, which will help us conduct a thorough examination of its strengths and weaknesses. 
We have also delved into more advanced GDB functions to help which has helped us navigate through intricate code structures and identify areas for improvement.
2)Pwntools : "Pwntools" is a powerful tool for hackers, enabling them to create custom codes for accessing computer systems. It allows us to create a sophisticated payload,
such as a hidden message, to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the Scanner challenge on Hack the Box, giving us an advantage in the game.
